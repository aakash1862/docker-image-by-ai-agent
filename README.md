# docker-image-by-ai-agent
This is a PoC I am trying to do where AI Agent will first create the Dockerfile and then build the image.

# How to run the Agent:
`python main.py run "prompt"` -- CLI Based calling

`streamlit run app.py` -- recommended method as this will open a UI on your localhost:8501
